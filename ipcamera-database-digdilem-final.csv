It has two feeds ,320x240 (Feed2) and 1280x720 (Feed 1)

Manual path settings are FFMPEG and rtsp://:@10.1.0.112:554/onvif1 for 1280x720

Does 15fps on a single feed. Too early to say how reliable but probably not great. Power is a 5v USB micro connector. No RJ45 connector, wifi only. Cannot set network details manually (broken interface) but DHCP works.

Cheap small camera. Android app is buggy. Website does not respond from Europe. Forget about support. ",
